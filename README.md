The Dashboard allows the visualization of the missing migrants who die in the process of migration towards an international destination.
The dataset comes from [The Missing Migrants Project](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/downloads), it is saved [here](https://gist.github.com/StefanoFrontini/94424c58cce5781ec8bc7f46150a53f7hj) and starts from 2014.

## Tech

React, Typescript, D3, Tailwind CSS.

## The challenge

The dashboard should display these features:

- The whole dataset on a world map;
- Aggregate the data by month and visualize it in a histogram;
- Pan and zoom the world map;
- Dynamically visualize on the world map only a subset of the data by selecting (brushing) the period on the histogram;
- Move the brush to dynamically update the data on the world map;
